## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **server root**:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDB
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id
```

> ⚠️ **Important**
> `require("dotenv").config()` must be the **first line** in `server.js` or `index.js`.

---

## 📤 Upload Flow

1. User selects a video
2. Instant preview is shown
3. On **Publish**:

   * Loading screen appears
   * Video uploads to ImageKit
   * Optimized URL is saved in MongoDB
   * Success popup is shown
   * User is redirected to dashboard

### This prevents:

* Multiple submit clicks
* Extra ImageKit charges
* Bad user experience

---

## ⚠️ ImageKit Video Limitation (Important)

This project uses the **ImageKit Free Plan**.

### Known Limitations

* Video transformation usage is limited

### After limit is exceeded:

* Video URLs still save in the database
* Video playback may stop working

### Why still deployed?

This project is intended for:

* Learning
* Portfolio showcase
* MVP / demo

### Architecture is upgrade‑ready for:

* Backend video streaming
* Cloudflare R2
* Bunny.net
* AWS S3 + CloudFront

---

## 🔒 Video Download Protection

* `controlsList="nodownload"` is used
* UI prevents casual downloads

> ⚠️ Client‑side video protection is **never 100% secure** (industry‑wide limitation).

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* Environment variables must load first
* Optimistic UI significantly improves UX
* Video platforms require backend streaming for scale
* Free tiers are for testing, not production
